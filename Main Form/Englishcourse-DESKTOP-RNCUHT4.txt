When gounding to the nearest 1000th always check the number before the last number (If the number is 1567 then look at number 5 - the number before the 1000th). Then use the check to see if it should round up or down. If the number is equal to 5 or greater than 5 we round up, if the number is less than 5 we round down. Remember, when rounding up we increase the thousand by one and replace all the other numbers with 0 (E.g. 1567 will round up because the number before the thousandth is 5. Therefore we will increase the one by one 1+1=2 and replace all the other numbers with 0: 567 -> 000. So, the rounded number of 1567 is 2000!) When rounding down we keep the thousand number the same and replace all the other numbers with 0. (E.g. 1273 will round down because 2 is less than 5, so we will keep the 1 and replace 273 with 000. So, the rounded number will be 1000).#
When adding thousands, work from left to right. First add the units, if the units added together greater than 10 then add 1 to the tens. Then go add the tens, if the sum of them are greater than 100 add 1 to the hundreds and so forth. Look at the example below:#
When subtracting numbers, left to right. Always subtract the smallest number from the biggest number (Big number over small number). If the number on top, is smaller than the number below it carry a number from the number from the left. So, if you have a number 473 - 129, 3 is less than 4 so we borrow a ten from the 7 and change the 3 to thirteen and 7 to 6. We then minus the 13 from the 9 and get 4. We continue to do this until we get our number!# 
When multiplying numbers, it is actually the same thing as just adding the same number mulitple times! So, if you have 9 x 4 it is the exact same thing as saying 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 (9+9 four times) which is equal to 36. Therefore, 9 x 4 = 36!#
When dividing numbers, put the bigger number over the smaller number. Then see how many times the smaller number can fit into the bigger number. For example, 28/7, we check how many times 7 can go into 28n. So, we say    7 + 7= 14 we still aren't at 24 so we continue 14 + 7 = 21 and again 21 + 7 = 28! So, 7 went into 28 4 times --> 24/7 = 4!#
When simplifying fractions look at the smallest number and find all of its factors (the numbers which can divide into it). E.g. 6/12 -- we look at 6 and write down its factors: [1,2,3,6] then when go from the highest factor to the lowest factor and see if the factor is a factor of the bigger number. So, in this case the highest factor of 6 is 6, using this we divide it into the bigger number and see if it a factor of 12. 12 has factors [1,2,3,4,6,12] so 6 is a factor! We then divide both numbers by six to get our answer. 6/12 = 1/2#
When using measurements always ensure the measurements are in the same unit (all of them are in meters or centimeters). Then all we do is add the measurements together to get our answer! E.g. bob has a closed off fence of lengths 51m, 100cm, 90m, 1km. What is the total length of the fence? First convert everything to meters ( 100cm --> 1m; 1km --> 1000m) then add 1 + 1000 + 51 + 90 = 1142m#
When working with time all we do is add as we would with a normal equation. But, with this instead when the minutes reach 60 we increase the hours and reset the minutes. E.g. 12:22 + 45minutes we add 45 to 22 = 67minutes --> 12:67 but the minutes are 67 so we instead add a 1 to the hours and minus 60 from the minutes --> 12+1=13 and 67-60 = 7 therefore getting us 13:07!#
When approaching a word equation we must first read the question and recognise what the problem is (are you adding numbers, multiplying numbers, subtracting numbers?). Then plan how you will answer the problem (add the numbers or subtract, etc), execute the plan and there is your answer!#
